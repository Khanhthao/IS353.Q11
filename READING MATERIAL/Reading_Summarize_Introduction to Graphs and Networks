- Definition of the networks: Networks are a general language for describing complex systems. 
- Around us, there are complex systems:
+ The society is a collection of 7+ billion individuals.
+ Communication systems link electronic devices.
+ Information and knowledge are organized and linked.
+ Interactions between thousands of genes/proteins regulate life.
+ Our thoughts are hidden in the connections between billions of neurons in our brain.
--> So to indicate the similarity of this systenm and represent them, we use the network.
