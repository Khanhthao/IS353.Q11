LECTURE 1: INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
* Overview of networks, some social principles and network concepts.
* Real - world examples and applications.
- Why networks: Networks are a general language for describing complex systems.
- The network indicates the similarities of many complex systems all around us:
+ Society is a collection of 7+ billion individuals.
+ Communication systems link electronic devices.
+ Information and knowledge are organized and linked.
+ Interactions between thousands of genes/proteins regulate life.
+ Our thoughts are hidden in the connections between billions of neurons in our brain.
- Behind many systems, there is an intricate wiring diagram, a network, that defines the interactions between the components.
- Many types of data are networks:
+ Social networks
+ Information networks: Web and citations.
+ Economic networks
+ Internet
+ Communication networks
+ Networks of neurons
+ Patient networks
+ Hierarchies of cell systems
+ Disease pathways
+ Genetic interaction networks
+ Gene co-expression networks
+ Cell - cell similarity networks
- Ways to analyze Networks: 
+ Predict the type/color of a given node: Node classification
+ Predict whether two nodes are linked: Link prediction
+ Identify desenly linked clusters of nodes: Community detection
+ Measure similarity of two nodes/networks: Network similarity
- Application of Networks:
+ (1): Networks: Social: Facebook social graph: Social Circle Detection
+ (2): Networks: Infrastructure
  . Understand how network structure affects the robustness of a system
  . Develop quantitative tools to assess the interplay betweeen the network structure and dynamical processes on the networks, and their impact on failures.
+ (3): Networks: Information, Knowledge: Knowledge, Heterogeneous, Multimodal Graphs
  . Application: Misinformation, Link Prediction: Content recommendation.
+ (4): Networks: Online Media: Polarization on Twitter and Predicting Virality or Product Adoption.
+ (5): Networks: Biology: Function Prediction: Classifying the function of proteins in the interactome.
- Why studying Networks: 
+ Patterns and statistical properties of network data
+ Design principles and models.
+ Algorithms and predictive models to answer questions and make predictions.
- How mining Networks:
+ Empirically: Find organizational principles:
  . How do we measure and quantify networks?
+ w/Mathematical Model: Graph theory and statistic models
  . Models allow us to understand behaviors and distinguish suprising from expected phenomena.
+ w/Algorithms for Analyzing graphs: Hard computational challenges.
